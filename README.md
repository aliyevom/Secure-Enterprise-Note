# Encryption Note for Enterprise


Encryption Note for Enterprise is a sophisticated note-keeping and task management application designed for enterprise-level use. It securely handles sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs), custom IDs, and personal data, ensuring that all notes are encrypted and access is tightly controlled. This application is built using React.js for the frontend, with plans to integrate a robust backend using Node.js and Express.js.

The application is designed to cater to the needs of large organizations by providing a secure platform for managing notes and tasks that may contain highly sensitive information. The encryption mechanism ensures that all data is protected from unauthorized access, while the logging feature keeps a detailed record of all activities for audit purposes. The enterprise-level access control allows for the implementation of various access levels, ensuring that employees only have access to the information they are authorized to view.

## Features

- **Note Encryption**: 
  - Utilizes AES-256 encryption to ensure all notes are securely encrypted before being stored.
  - Encrypted data is safely stored in the local storage until the backend integration is complete.
  - A unique encryption key is generated for each user session to enhance security.

- **Enterprise-Level Access**:
  - Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
  - Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, manager, employee) which dictate the level of access they have to different notes.
  - Access tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users, ensuring secure access across the application.

- **Logging**:
  - Maintains detailed logs of all actions performed by users, including note creation, modification, and deletion.
  - Logs are timestamped and include user identification for audit trails.
  - Logs are securely stored and can be accessed by administrators for review.

- **Task Management**:
  - Provides a comprehensive task management system that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
  - Tasks can be linked to notes for better organization and tracking.
  - Task statuses can be updated to reflect progress, helping teams stay on top of their work.

## E2E

- **Backend Integration**:
  - Develop a backend using Node.js and Express.js to handle data storage, retrieval, updates, and deletions.
  - Ensure the backend is scalable and can handle a large volume of requests and data.
  - Implement database solutions (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to securely store encrypted notes and logs.

- **API Development**:
  - Create RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
  - APIs will handle user authentication, note and task management, and log retrieval.
  - Ensure APIs are secure, utilizing HTTPS and proper authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT).

- **Advanced Security Features**:
  - Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security for user accounts.
  - Enhance RBAC to include more granular permission settings, allowing for fine-tuned access control.
  - Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
